Hypothesis 
is that MDS2 controls a metabolite pathway in glioblastoma stem cells.

DATA
Data is metabolite abundances across cell samples. 
Samples:
	4 replicates of 2 cell lines at 2 different time points: 
		differentiated glioma cells (DGCs) and glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs),
		lines 383 and 3565

RESULTS
PCA - done. 
 as expected, GSCs from the two lines are more similar than DGCs from the same 2 lines.
 II_D04_383_DGC_4 is an outlier in PCs 1 and especially 2.

Clustermap - done. 
 Most metabolites differential between the two cell types.
 II_D04_383_DGC_4 is an outlier.
 Log2 transform > quantile normalize > standardize > PCA
												   > hierarchical clustering
 Hierarchical clustering best parameterization:
  best: average distance, cosine distance.
  NB: after standardization, cosine = correlation distance
  also tried clustering without quantile normalization; standardize;

DISCUSSION
PC1 - cell type
PC2 - sequencing quality? cell line?

Todo:
	log-log plot of metabolite abundance against some other measure, don't think we have it.
	 Would need to follow up with the Rich team
	Let Jill and Lukas know.
